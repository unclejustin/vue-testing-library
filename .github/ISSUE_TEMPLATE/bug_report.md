- For questions related to using the library, please visit a support community
  instead of filing an issue on GitHub: https://spectrum.chat/testing-library

- Please fill out this template with all the relevant information so we can
  understand what's going on and fix the issue.

- If you're issue is regarding one of the query APIs (`getByText`,
  `getByLabelText`, etc), then please file it on the `@testing-library/dom`
  repository instead. Thanks :)
